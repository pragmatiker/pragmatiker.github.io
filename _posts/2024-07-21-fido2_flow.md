FIDO2 and WebAuthn are technologies that enhance online security by replacing passwords with stronger authentication methods.

***FIDO2:*** 
An industry standard developed by the FIDO Alliance that allows users to authenticate securely using devices like smartphones, hardware tokens, or biometrics (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition). FIDO2 makes logins easier and more secure by eliminating the need for passwords, reducing the risk of phishing and credential theft.

***WebAuthn:***
A key component of FIDO2, WebAuthn (Web Authentication) is a web standard published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It enables web applications to interact with authenticators like biometrics or hardware tokens, facilitating passwordless logins and multi-factor authentication. WebAuthn provides a seamless and secure authentication experience across websites and services.

Together, FIDO2 and WebAuthn offer a robust solution to the problems associated with traditional passwords, enhancing user security and convenience in the digital world.
